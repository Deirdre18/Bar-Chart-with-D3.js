    <!--At this point we have been introduced to SVG's - the fundamentals of scalable vector graphics. We've been introduced to the basics of D3 which manipulates and works on scalable vector graphics. But it does it programmatically using javascript. Now let's look at creating a bar chart similar to the one we created a couple of Units back but this time creating it programmatically using D3.-->
    <h1>Data Visualisation</h1>

    <h2>D3 Charting</h2>

    <div id="draw-here"></div>

    <script>
    //So we have a data set here of discrete integer values and we are setting our height with a bar padding variables for use later on. This pattern is quite common.
    //var w = 500;
    //var h = 500;
    //var barPadding = 1;
    
    //Let's test that again, again the relationships between the values is maintained just within a smaller viewport.
    
    //var w = 300;
    //var h = 300;
    //var barPadding = 1;
    
    //let's put it to a much higher number again so there is a bit of an art to getting your proportions in your data set right so data visualizations is a mixture of art and science.
    
    var w = 800;
    var h = 800;
    var barPadding = 1;
    
    
    var dataset = [
        450, 100, 100, 279, 500, 25, 350, 120, 80, 130,
        110, 102, 375, 200, 175, 168, 180, 230, 205,
    ];
    // We use our D3 object to create an SVG object. We're using Select and the Select ties our viewport to a div with an ID called draw-here. Once we've that done we then append an SVG as a child of that div and it's part of the document object model (DOM)and the height and the width of that viewport is determined by the h and w variables set out below.

    //there you have it there's our bar chart you can see the heights you can see the padding and again the default color is black because unless you specify otherwise both text and textual elements will be rendered in black by default in the browser so let's refactor this a little bit just do a little bit of cleaning so let's set the column width.

    //we can actually clean this up even more it's called the bar with so we can remove those and clean up our code. It doesn't necessarily improve our execution speed but it makes it a little bit more elegant and more readable - run it, okay and that works.

    //var colWidth = w / dataset.length;
    //var barWidth = colWidth - barPadding;
    
    //  D3 Scaling - linear used for number values.  Ordinal is used for non-numeric values (names, places, etc).

//  so what a linear scale allows you to do is work with the domain and the range. 

 
    //var scale = d3.scale.linear()
                        //.domain([0,500]);
                        
    //so let's go back and modify our our chart to allow for the value of 600 which is in our data set which exceeds the height of view the viewport.  Okay let's set our domain to 600 and we have our range set to 500 just like in our test.  
    
    
   // var scale = d3.scale.linear()
                //.domain([0,600])
                //.range([0,500]);

    ////what if we're not sure of the size of our data set at any given time before the data arrives well we can use what's called d3 max, so it'll set the domain to the highest value contained within the dataset, so you don't have to hard code again.  It frees you up and it makes the code more flexible. 
    
    
    var scale = d3.scale.linear()
                .domain([0, d3.max(dataset)])
                .range([0, h]);

    
                        
    
                        
//  There won't always be a direct mapping between your data points and actual pixel on the screen, so for example, if you're plotting a graph of some figures like sales figures and the sales are in the tens or hundreds of thousands, it's very unlikely you'll be able to create a bar graph with the same pixel height as the data, so in that case you need to specify the boundaries within which your data can be transformed and these boundaries are called a range, and usually make a range when you want to transform the value of raw data into corresponding pixel coordinates, so our domain allows for values up to 600 and our range allows for values up to 500.  So there's a constraint and if we enter in the values here and if we do a test, we can see that 600 is the maximum height at 600 that will be displayed is 500 pixels, and relative to that a value of 500 will display a value of 416.6, so the boundary of the range is 500.  So the range constrains our data within a viewport. 

//  testing.
    //var scale = d3.scale.linear()
                //.domain([0,600])
                //.range([0,500]);

    //console.log(scale(0));
    //console.log(scale(600));
    //console.log(scale(500));



//Think of the domain as the boundary between the lowest and highest value represented in your data set you can test these then by adding values so a value of 500 in our case because the domain is set to 500 Max will display at a scale of 1 to 1 and a value of 0 will display it's get scale 0 as we cans see here.
    
//if we then change the value to 400 for example which is less than the boundary max it will display as a percentage of total which is 0.8 400 is 0.8 of 500.
//  testing

    //console.log(scale(0));
    //console.log(scale(500));
    
   // console.log(scale(0));
    //console.log(scale(400));




    var svg = d3.select("#draw-here")
        .append("svg")
        .attr("width", w)
        .attr("height", h);


    // now we're setting up our bar chart and have defined what the rectangle will look like, so we append a rectangle, going to give it its X&Y coordinates, its height and its width so let's set the x coordinate and again this would be a function and the function U takes in two parameters. Ours uses two parameters d and i. d is the data which is the actual value in a in the data set array and i is the index of that data and the x value is going to be the width divided by the data set length. Remember the length property is available on every array in JavaScript

    svg.selectAll("rect")
        .data(dataset)
        .enter()
        .append("rect")
        .attr("x", function(d, i) {
            return i * (w / dataset.length);
        //.attr("x", function(d, i) {
          //  return i * colWidth;
        })


        // let's set the Y value for each bar and the height - d. and remember the length property is available on every array in JavaScript.
        
        // okay.  Run it and everything fits within the viewport it's very very powerful feature once this clicks you're really on your way with them with d3 what if we're not sure of the size of our data set at any given time before the data arrives well we can use what's called d3 max so it'll set the domain to the highest value contained within the data set so you don't have to hard code again it frees you up it makes the code more flexible let's test that again again the relationships between the values is maintained just within a smaller viewport let's put it to a much higher number again so there is a bit of an art to getting your proportions in your data set right so data visualizations is a mixture of art and science.

        //.attr("y", function(d) {
           // return h - d;
        //})
        ////D3 Scaling -  make some changes here so we use the scale function that was returned from the d3 scale. Modifying y value.
        .attr("y", function(d) {
            return h - scale(d);
        })
        //Let's set the width and the width will be W divided by the data set length minus the barpadding. Lets check that now by running it.
        .attr("width", w / dataset.length - barPadding)
        
        //so that's replace our earlier calculation with colWidth, then remove and clean up our code, replacing colWidth, with barWidth).

        //.attr("width", w / barWidth)
         //now let's set the rectangle height and it'll be d that'll be the actual value of the data at that point in the array.
        //Modify our height and our y-values using the scale, and run it, everything is ok. 
        .attr("height", function(d) {
            return scale(d);
        });





   svg.selectAll("text")
       .data(dataset)
        .enter()
        .append("text")
        .text(function(d) {
            return d;
        })
        
//now we would like to make our data visualization (our bar chart) that little bit more informative, that a little bit more visually visually richer, and in order to do that, let's display the actual values (the integer values) for each bar, represent them on the bar itself. In other words, the data entries are the datums inside in the dataset.  Let's display those on the bar, each bar element itself to provide a richer feedback to the viewer, so in this case we use a text object, again we bind the text to the dataset, that's where we get our values from.  So for each entry in the dataset, there will be a text object created.        
        
//  again we bind the text to the dataset, that's where we get our values from. So for each entry in the dataset, there will be a text object created.  
    
//    and we're specifying the x-coordinate of our entry in the middle of each bar chart so you can see it there more informative richer we're moving along nicely we're now using d3 to programmatically bind data to SVG's and represent them in a visual format.

//  On the first line you can see there's a an attribute, it's an SVG attribute called text anchor and we're setting it to middle. It's a bit like a normal text editor such as word or so on you have left align, middle and right align, so we're Center aligning our text on the bar itself.
        .attr("text-anchor", "middle")
        
//  we're specifying the x-coordinate of our entry in the middle of each bar chart so you can see it there more informative and richer
        .attr("x", function(d, i) {
            return i * (w / dataset.length) + (w / dataset.length - barPadding) / 2;
        })
        
//  Notice the Y value we are using the height minus d plus 14, so it'll be 14 pixels down from the top of the bar itself.
        .attr("y", function(d) {
            return h - scale(d)+ 14;
        })
        
//  and we're setting some additional text properties, such as the font family default sans-serif and giving it a font size of 11 pixels.
        .attr("font-family", "sans-serif")
        .attr("font-size", "11px")
//  and we're going to fill the text element with the color white. You can use hex values as well we're just using the the web palette representation that limited web palette representation just for simplicity
        .attr("fill", "white");
        
//  This is how we use d3 to programmatically bind data to SVG's and represent them in a visual format.
